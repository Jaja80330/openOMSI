//! is the rain as it sounds in the street (the bus plays its own `regen.wav` on the roof,
//! `[viewpoint] 2`, inside the cab), and `Sounds\Passengers\sound.cfg` holds the footstep
//! entry with its volume and its `[3d]` range - one metre, so a step is only heard from a
//! few metres away. The wet-road hiss (`Sounds\WetLane_1.wav`, `WetLane_2.wav`) belongs to
//! the vehicles and comes out of their own sound configurations once `StreetCond` is fed.
